## Introduction

Billify automates the process of extracting structured data from receipts and invoices. This project utilizes PaddleOCR for text extraction and a fine-tuned LLM from Hugging Face Transformers for converting raw OCR text into structured JSON format.

## Features

- **Image Input**: Supports common image formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF) and batch processing.
- **OCR Text Extraction**: Uses PaddleOCR to handle various layouts and fonts in receipts and invoices.
- **Structured JSON Output**: Extracts key information such as store name, date, items, quantities, prices, and total amount.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for unclear or erroneous OCR results.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of images efficiently.
- **Security**: Ensures data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Installation

To set up Billify, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Billify.git
   cd Billify
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
   - Install Hugging Face Transformers:
     ```bash
     pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
     pip install accelerate
     ```
   - Install PaddleOCR:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR.git
     cd PaddleOCR
     python3 -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu
     pip install "paddleocr>=2.0.1"
     ```

## Usage

1. **Import necessary libraries**:
   ```python
   import torch
   from paddleocr import PaddleOCR
   from transformers import pipeline
   ```

2. **Initialize PaddleOCR**:
   ```python
   ocr = PaddleOCR(use_angle_cls=True, lang='en')
   ```

3. **Extract OCR text from an image**:
   ```python
   img_path = 'path_to_receipt_image.jpg'
   ocr_result = ocr.ocr(img_path, cls=True)
   raw_text = " ".join([line[1][0] for line in ocr_result[0]])
   ```

4. **Convert raw text to structured JSON using the fine-tuned LLM**:
   ```python
   model = pipeline('text2json', model='zephyr-7b-alpha')
   def convert_to_json(raw_text):
       structured_data = model(raw_text)
       return structured_data
   structured_json = convert_to_json(raw_text)
   ```

## Architecture

The system is organized into the following modules:
1. **Image Input Module**: Handles the upload and storage of image files.
2. **OCR Processing Module**: Uses PaddleOCR to extract text from images.
3. **Text-to-JSON Conversion Module**: Employs a fine-tuned LLM to convert raw OCR text into structured JSON format.
4. **Output Module**: Provides the structured JSON data to the user or integrates it with existing business systems.
