# Billify
Billify (Receipt Radar)
 1. Executive Summary
 Billify has been developed to streamline the conversion of raw OCR text from receipts
 and invoices into structured JSON format. This system leverages advanced OCR
 technology and a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide an efficient and
 accurate tool for automating data extraction and processing from physical documents.
 This report outlines the project requirements, technical implementation, business
 feasibility, and the advantages of our solution.

 1. OCR:PaddleOCR
 2. LLM:HuggingFace Transformers
 ● Hardware:GPUsforefficient processing
 ● Platform:Cloud-based or on-premise deployment options
 3. Technical Implementation
 3.1. System Architecture
 1. ImageInputModule:Handlestheupload and storage of image files.
 2. OCRProcessing Module:Utilizes PaddleOCR to extract text from images.
 3. Text-to-JSON Conversion Module: Employs a fine-tuned LLM to convert
 raw OCRtext into structured JSON format.
 4. Output Module: Provides the structured JSON data to the user or integrates it
 with existing business systems.
 3.2. Implementation Steps
 1. Libraries Installation:
 ● Necessary libraries include Hugging Face Transformers and PaddleOCR.
 ● Toinstall the Hugging Face Transformers library, the command pip install
 git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git is used.
● Theaccelerate library is installed to optimize model performance with the
 commandpipinstall accelerate.
 ● PaddleOCR can be installed by cloning its repository from GitHub (git
 clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR.git) and installing
 the required dependencies (pip install "paddleocr>=2.0.1").
 ● Additionally, PaddleOCR requires the paddlepaddle-gpu library for GPU
 acceleration, which can be installed using the command python3-m pip
 install paddlepaddle-gpu.
 2. Libraries Import:
 ● The essential libraries such as torch for PyTorch, PaddleOCR for OCR
 tasks, and pipeline from Hugging Face Transformers for model inference,
 are imported into the project.
 3. OCRTextExtraction:
 ● PaddleOCR is initialized with appropriate settings for angle classification
 and language.
 ● Images of receipts or invoices are passed through the PaddleOCR to
 extract text. This text extraction handles various layouts and fonts
 commonly found in such documents.
 4. Text-to-JSON Conversion:
 ● Afine-tuned LLM from Hugging Face (the zephyr-7b-alpha model) is
 utilized to convert the raw OCR text into a structured JSON format.
 ● Afunction is defined to take the raw text as input and produce structured
 JSON output, capturing essential details such as store name, date, items,
 quantities, prices, and total amount.
 4. Business Feasibility
